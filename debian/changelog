xfonts-base (1:1.0.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop paragraph about xfonts-base-transcoded from the description. That
    package has been dropped in the modular packaging, and the fonts it used
    to contain are now in xfonts-base.  Thanks again to Josip Rodin!
  * Import 1:1.0.0-5.1 NMU from Hideki Yamane.
  * Revert inappropriate NMU changes:
    - change debian/compat back to 5
    - the download page is not a homepage
    - use dh_clean -k in the install target, not plain dh_clean
  * Update xsfbs.

xfonts-base (1:1.0.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Branden Robinson ]
  * Update Debian copyright file.
    + Remove Adobe copyright notices; nothing in the upstream sources
      case-insensitive matches "adobe", let alone bears a copyright notice of
      theirs.
    + Add many copyright notices, licenses, and other notations of status
      (such as "public domain") from upstream sources.
    + Add other information required by Debian Policy ยง12.5.
  * Update package description.
    + Stop claiming that the package also provides font file manipulation
      utilities.  It no longer does; those moved to xfonts-utils.  (To aid
      transitions, xfonts-base should have grown a dependency on xfonts-utils,
      but etch is out now and it's too late to help people upgrading from
      sarge.)
    + Stop documenting the dependency on xutils; debhelper now worries about
      this for us via dh_installxfonts and ${misc:Depends}, so the dependency
      is no longer directly our responsibility.

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * Add upstream URL to debian/copyright (closes: #434288).  Thanks, Josip
    Rodin!
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
